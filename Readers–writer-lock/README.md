# Readers–writer lock

## Summary

This program simulate a simple Readers–writer lock mechanism that is more "fair" towards the writers<br />
Any reader that want to read get permission but when a writer wish to get access all the readers afterwards have to wait<br />
This protocol might not solve starvation completly but it is a better solution for writers<br />
The program uses main's data strucutre in round-robin, strucutre sizes can be changes by using NUM_THREADS define<br />

The code was written independately to maintain and improve my pthreads and synchronization skills.<br />
Program code is inspired by "Operating System" course in the Technion, mainly from the tutoroal synchronization slides by Idan Yaniv<br />

## How to use the program:
each line takes 2 arguments<br />
In each line, the user have to write 'quit' or specify 2 arguments '<type> <sleep time>'<br />
when type is "read" or "write" wich indicated the activity the user want to specify<br />
and sleeping time is number between 0 to 5<br />
"to end the program type \"quit\"<br />

- compile it with:
```
g++ -std=c++11 -g -Wall main.cxx -o executable -lpthread
```

- running example:
```
./executable
Please type the commands you with to perform in the format <type> <sleep time>
when type is "read" or "write"
and time is number between 0 to 5
to end the program type "quit"
